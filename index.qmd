## Get Started

Head to workshop [Materials](materials.qmd)

## Description

As a data professional, at some point, you’ll want a website, whether it’s for yourself, a project, or a research group. Quarto is a great way to make one: build your site with plain text files that you can edit in your favorite tool and check in to version control; structure your content into folders and pages in a way that makes sense to you; create content that includes code and its output; and generate listing pages that help readers navigate collections of content like projects, publications or people.

In this workshop, you'll walk you through the process from scratch. You’ll see how to get started with a basic template and then edit it to your needs, including adding pages, customizing navigation, adding a blog or other listing, personalizing the appearance, and getting it online.

This workshop will be hands-on, and you'll need to prepare a few things before it begins. Look for instructions closer to the day. It will help if you've already used Quarto to produce documents, but I'll provide a few resources to get you up to speed beforehand if you haven't. You don't need any HTML, CSS/SCSS or Git/GitHub experience, nor do you need any particular programming language (R, Python etc.) or level of programming experience.
